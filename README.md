# Technologies used
-HTML: for the structure and content of the page

-CSS: to style the pages and make them responsive on all devices

-Javascript: to make it interactive, namely the search bar and the filters of the page

-jQuery: this javascript library was used to manipulate the DOM, handle events, and mostly to make AJAX requests

-AJAX: to allow web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes without requiring the entire page to reload, which allows new cards to be displayed to users simultaneously as the admins upload them

-MySQL: is the database management system that was used to deal with data such as users authentication and images of places with their attributes

-PHP: was used to retrieve data from the database for the cards and for the login / signup pages

-JSON: was used to parse the data from mysql as a JSON object to make easier the storingm, display and manipulation of the data


# Future Improvements
